The Electrum Bitcoin client uses a 128-bits random seed to generate its private keys.<br/>
<br/>
The seed can be represented as a 12-words mnemonic code:<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
If you lose your wallet, it can be recovered at any time from the mnemonic code or from the seed:<br/>

<br/>
That's it! you no longer have to worry about wallet backups. 
All you need to remember is twelve words.
